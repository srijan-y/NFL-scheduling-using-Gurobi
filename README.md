# NFL-scheduling-using-Gurobi
NFL-Final.py is the final file which takes into consideration 22 hard and soft constraints to create a schedule for the NFL 2018 season. 
They are just 22 of the known constraints where as in reality more than 700 exist. 
More constraints can be added which can improve the model.
